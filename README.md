## What is Checkmate?

Most study apps give you a timer and call it productivity. Checkmate is different — it knows **who you are**, **what exam you're preparing for**, **which topics you're weak in**, **when your coaching tests are**, and generates a **specific, reasoned daily plan** around all of it.

It also makes sure you actually execute that plan — with a floating attention bar, distraction blocking, WhatsApp guardian reports, and an AI mentor that gives real feedback, not generic motivation.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Adaptive AI Planner
- Generates topic-specific tasks, not vague ones ("Torque — coaching test in 2 days, PYQ 6.2%, you marked weak")
- Powered by Groq (LLaMA 3.1) with rule-based fallback — works even offline
- Driven by your full profile: exam target, score gap, weak topics, stress level, available hours
- Brings in your coaching test schedule, daily topic check-in, and past behavior

### 👤 Student Consultation Profile
- One-time setup: exam, exam date, class, coaching name, target score, mock scores, weak subjects/topics, sleep hours, stress level, blocked time slots
- Drives every decision the planner makes — nothing is generic

### 📅 Daily Check-In
- Every morning: select today's topics from the official NTA syllabus (JEE / NEET / CUET)
- Rate yesterday's sessions, log your stress and sleep
- Resets at 3 AM, feeds directly into today's plan generation

### 📋 Coaching Schedule Upload
- Paste or type your coaching test + lecture schedule
- Groq extracts a structured schedule — upcoming tests, subjects, chapters
- Planner always knows what's coming in the next 7 days

### ⏱️ Attention Cycle System
- 30-min focus → 5-min break → 10-min long break
- Floating overlay bar with phase timer and confirm button
- **Pause / Resume** support — tracks real focus time, not wall clock time
- Stats show actual focus time, pause count, pause rate (fatigue signals)

### 🚫 WorkMode (Distraction Blocker)
- Blocks selected apps during study sessions
- Accessibility service-based — no root needed

### 💬 WhatsApp Guardian Reports
- Sends study session summaries to a parent/guardian via WhatsApp
- Runs in an isolated process — survives even if main app is killed

### 🤖 Mentor AI
- Chat interface with a mentor that knows your full situation
- Injected with: your profile, behavior ledger, PYQ weightage, exam strategy
- Gives specific, curriculum-aware guidance — not motivational quotes
- Knows JEE/NEET chapter difficulty, common misconceptions, spaced repetition strategy, burnout recovery

### 📊 Stats & Behavior Ledger
- Tracks skip rate, streak, attention cycles, pause patterns
- Behavior data feeds back into planner and mentor for personalized adjustments

### 🔊 Voice Feedback (TTS)
- Android TTS built-in, ElevenLabs as optional upgrade
- Planner speaks plan summary after generation
- Configurable via settings toggle

### 🔑 BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)
- Multi-provider LLM support: Groq, OpenRouter, Claude, Gemini
- You control your API keys — no subscription, no data sent to our servers
